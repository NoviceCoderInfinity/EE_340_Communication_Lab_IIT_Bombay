# LAB 2 Small Note
In order to run [Program 3 IQ Demodulation](Q3_IQ_DeModulation.grc). You would need to run the [Program 3 IQ Modulation file](Q3_IQ_Modulation.grc),
until your data1.dat file crosses the file size of 2GB to be safe. Else you will face hiccups when you run the Program 3 IQ Demodulation for small data1.dat file size.
